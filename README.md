# Head-Detection-Yolov8
This repo provides a YOLOv8 model, finely trained for detecting human heads in complex crowd scenes, with the CrowdHuman dataset serving as training data. To boost accessibility and compatibility, I've reconstructed the labels in the CrowdHuman dataset, refining its annotations to perfectly match the YOLO format.
